## About This Handbook

This Handbook's primary audience is Enspiral contributors, but it will be publicly available for others who might find it useful. The goal is to give everyone in the network as much clarity and context as possible, while sharing our structures and practices with the outside world as well.

This book is in a very early stage of development. Much of it hasn't been written yet. If you see something that could be improved: that's your invitation to improve it! [Find out more about editing the handbook](guides/contributing.md).

## Structure

The book is broken up into chapters and sub-chapters. The chapters are:

* [**Agreements**](agreements.md) are the official legislation that governs the Enspiral network. Changing these requires a formal process.
* [**Guides**](guides.md) explain in practical terms how we do stuff, like [what communications tools to use](/guides/comms_guidelines.md), or [how to improve things at Enspiral](/guides/improvements.md). Any Contributor can change these.
